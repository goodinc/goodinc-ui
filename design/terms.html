To give notice of alleged copyright infringement, please send a notice to:</p>
    <p>Cara Kitagawa-Sellers<br/>

      <a href="mailto:copyright@goodinc.com">copyright@goodinc.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>GOOD reserves the right to remove content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, without liability to you.  In appropriate circumstances GOOD will also terminate a user’s account if the person is determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>
    <p>If GOOD decides to remove or disable access to Content you have posted as the result of receiving a DMCA notification, we will notify you after removing or disabling access.  In our notice, we will provide you access to the reporter’s complaint along with instructions on how to file a counter-notice.</p>
    <p>If you believe that the material reported in the DMCA notification you received was misidentified or removed in error you should file a counter notice by responding to our original email notification of the removal and include the required information in the body of your reply as we discard all attachments for security reasons.   In your response, please provide the following information:  (1) a physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice); (2) identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the description from the DMCA notice will suffice); (3) statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and (4) your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which GOOD may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.</p>
    <p>Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, GOOD will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original notice.  If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.</p>

    <p>Entire Agreement. The Terms of Service, including GOOD's Privacy Policy which are hereby incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and GOOD and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and GOOD.</p>
        
    <p>Governing Laws. The Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        
    <p>Dispute Resolution. Except as provided herein, no civil action with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service may be commenced until the matter has been submitted to JAMS for mediation. The parties agree that any such mediation shall take place in Los Angeles County, California, USA. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may seek equitable relief prior to the mediation to preserve the status quo pending the completion of that process. Except for such an action to obtain equitable relief, neither party may commence a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 45 days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the commencement of a civil action, if the parties so desire. The provisions of this section may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.</p>
        
    <p>Waiver and Severability. The failure of GOOD to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties to this Agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
        
    <p>Notices. GOOD may provide you with notices, including, without limitation, those regarding changes to the Terms of Service and other service-related announcements, by postings on the Service (for example, by posting to the blog, or on the relevant page(s) of the Service affected by such changes).</p>
        
    <p>Trademarks. GOOD, the GOOD logo, and other GOOD logos and names are trademarks of GOOD. You agree not to display or use these trademarks in any manner without GOOD's prior, written consent.</p>
